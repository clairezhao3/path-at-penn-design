# path-at-penn-design
This project is a static prototype of a redesigned **Path@Penn** course registration interface, built for coursework.  
It is implemented in plain **HTML** and **CSS** to simulate the UI design at phone dimensions.

styles.css # Stylesheet for layout and design
README.md # This file

### Instructions for Running Code:

2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).  
3. The interface will display.

#### Attributions
- Base project structure (index.html, styles.css, README.md) was created by me and adapted on from in-class project 1. 
- Two snippets for UI elements (e.g., course cards, grid calendar layout) were generated with assistance from ChatGPT
- All other code and styling decisions are original.
